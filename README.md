# VibeSync

`VibeSync` is a Node.js library designed to update the status of a Discord voice channel. This library simplifies the process of setting custom statuses for voice channels using the Discord API.

## Installation

To install `VibeSync`, run:

```bash
npm install VibeSync
```
# Usage
## Importing and Setup
First, you need to import the VCStatus class and initialize it with your Discord bot client.
```js
const { Client } = require('discord.js');
const { VCStatus } = require('VibeSync');

const client = new Client();
const vcStatus = new VCStatus(client);

```
## Updating Voice Channel Status
Use the `updateVoiceChannel` method to set a custom status for a specific voice channel.
```js
const channelId = 'your-voice-channel-id';
const status = 'New Status';

vcStatus.updateVoiceChannel(channelId, status)
    .then(() => console.log('Status updated successfully'))
    .catch(err => console.error('Error updating status:', err));

```

# Example
## Hereâ€™s a complete example demonstrating how to use `VibeSync`:
```js
const { Client } = require('discord.js');
const { VCStatus } = require('VibeSync');

const client = new Client();
const vcStatus = new VCStatus(client);

client.once('ready', () => {
    console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);
    const channelId = 'your-voice-channel-id';
    const status = 'Custom Status';

    vcStatus.updateVoiceChannel(channelId, status)
        .then(() => console.log('Voice channel status updated successfully'))
        .catch(err => console.error('Failed to update voice channel status:', err));
});

client.login('your-bot-token');
```

# Error Handling
## The updateVoiceChannel method handles errors by differentiating between:

- API Errors: Errors received from the Discord API.
- No Response: Cases where no response is received from the API.
- Request Setup Errors: Issues with setting up the request.
- Errors are logged with color-coded messages using chalk.
